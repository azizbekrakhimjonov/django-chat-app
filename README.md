    • Writing consumer | routing | asgi
        Consumers are the equivalent of Django views for asynchronous applications.
        Channels provides routing classes that allow you to combine
        and stack consumers to dispatch based on what the connection is. You can think
        of them as the URL routing system of Django for asynchronous applications.
        Add routings to config routings
